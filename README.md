# 100 Days of Computer Vision

Welcome to the 100 Days of Computer Vision program! This initiative is designed to help you build a strong foundation in computer vision and deepen your understanding through practical application. Over the course of 100 days, you will explore various topics, ranging from basic image processing to advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## How to Participate

1. Fork this repository to create your own copy.
2. Create a folder with your GitHub username within the main directory.
3. For each day's task, create a subfolder within your username folder.
4. Commit your code, images, and any other relevant materials to the corresponding subfolder.
5. Submit a pull request to contribute your work to the main repository.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Each task should be organized in a clear and coherent manner within your designated folders.
- Provide a README.md file within each task's subfolder that outlines your approach, the techniques used, and any insights or challenges faced during the implementation.
- Include relevant code, images, and any additional resources that support your work.

## Tasks

Check the [tasks.md](./tasks.md) file for a detailed list of tasks for each day. Each task is designed to build upon the previous day's learnings, gradually progressing from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics in computer vision.

## Resources

To support your learning journey, we have compiled a list of resources and references related to each task. Check the Resources folder for additional learning materials and tutorials.
